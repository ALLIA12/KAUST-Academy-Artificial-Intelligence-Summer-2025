## Program Overview

The KAUST Academy Artificial Intelligence Summer School 2025 is designed to provide participants with an in-depth understanding of key AI domains, including Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. The program spans eight weeks, with dedicated modules of three weeks on Computer Vision, two weeks on Reinforcement Learning, and three weeks on Natural Language Processing. Through a blend of theoretical instruction and hands-on projects, students will gain practical skills and insights into emerging challenges across these core areas of AI.

## Topics Covered

- Day 1(RECAP): Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Layers (Conv, Pool, Activation), Padding, Strides, Architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, MobileNet).
- Day 2: Unsupervised Learning Overview (Definition, Applications, Challenges, Types: Clustering, DimRed, Anomaly Det.), Dimensionality Reduction Intro (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
- Day 3: Autoencoders (AE) - Concepts, Architecture, Applications (DimRed, Denoising, Super-Res, Colorization), Generative limitations. VAE Introduction.
- Day 4: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) - Variational Inference, ELBO, Reparameterization Trick, Results, Disentangled VAEs.
- Day 5: Autoregressive Models (Concept, FVSBN, NADE, RNADE, PixelRNN, PixelCNN, Pros/Cons).
- Day 6: Object Detection Overview (Challenges, IoU, Single Object Detection as Regression/Classification, Sliding Window Issues, Region Proposals, R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO Versions).
